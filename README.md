# dotfiles
my archlinux\hyprland dotfiles, **HEAVILY** inspired by android & [material design 3](m3.material.io).

## here's what is done so far:
- [x] hyprland config
- [ ] hyprlock
- [x] waybar
- [ ] rofi
- [x] notifications [mako]
- [x] terminal [kitty, fish&starship] (will add some changes to fish later)
- [ ] yazi (~~theming~~, keymap)
- [ ] etc. (~~wallpaper changing script~~, logout menu, settings menu, cursors, GTK)
